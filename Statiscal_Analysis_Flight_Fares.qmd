## Introduction.

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

##### LOAD REQUIRED LIBRARIES

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
library(png)
library(grid)
library(lattice)
library(readxl)
library(lubridate)
library(scales)

```

##### LOAD DATASET

```{r}
train <- read_excel("/Users/macbookpro/Downloads/RR_finalProject/Data_Train.xlsx")
```

To get dimension of our dataset, i.e., shape

```{r}
dim(train)
```

To print the top 5 rows of our dataset

```{r}
head(train, 5)
```



##### HANDLING MISSING DATA

To check for missing values and drop missing values

```{r}
print(colSums(is.na(train)))
train <- na.omit(train)

```

##### CLEAN DATE OF JOURNEY VARIABLE

To extract day, month, year, and weekday from Date of Journey

```{r}
train$Journey_Day <- day(dmy(train$Date_of_Journey))
train$Journey_Month <- month(dmy(train$Date_of_Journey))
train$Journey_Year <- year(dmy(train$Date_of_Journey))
train$weekday <- wday(dmy(train$Date_of_Journey), label = TRUE)
```




Remove the Date_of_Journey column since it is no longer needed

```{r}
train$Date_of_Journey <- NULL
```

Now we can see the list of column names in our dataset

```{r}
names(train)
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
