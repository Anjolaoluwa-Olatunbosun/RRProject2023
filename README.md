# RRProject2023

This project converts and extends a Python notebook on "Statistical Analysis & EDA for flight fare" using R and Quarto notebook. The original notebook can be found on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/code/ananyanandi02/statistical-analysis-eda-for-flight-fare/notebook . The dataset had a total of 10,682 observations with 10 independent variables and a continuous dependent variable (flight prices). R codes were used to carry out data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis using data visualization and correlation analysis, as well as data modelling using simple linear regression model-lm().

Through data modelling, it was observed that variables such as weekday, month, journey day, total stops, duration, arrival time, source to destination, and airlines significantly impact flight prices.
